On this tab, we can compare the climate change robustness of different decision sets. The table below shows the selected rows from the previous tab. The heatmaps show the value of a selected metric in color, while temperature increase and percentage precipitation change are shown on the x and y axes, respectively. Using these charts, then, we can see how the performance of a metric changes in different climate futures.

To adjust the metric to be plotted, or the decision set to examine, select a different value from the drop down menus.
