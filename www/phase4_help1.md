As we have now reached Phase 4 of the Decision Tree, we have identified that our current design is significantly vulnerable to climate change. Therefore, we want to explore different design and operating choices to find a decision set that is robust to the climate change scenarios we consider most likely.

The **first step** is to find a particular decision set that meets our needs under historical climate (no climate change). The parallel coordinates plot below compares several reliability metrics of 135 different decision sets, *under historical climate*. Each of these decision sets is represented by a different line on the parallel coordinates plot, with its intersection at each axis representing its value for that metric. 

You can filter the lines shown on the plot by adjusting the sliders and hitting the "filter" button. You can also click and drag along an axis to highlight the lines that pass through that section of the axis.

The **second step** is to analyze the climate change robustness of a small number of decision sets with acceptable performance. The decision sets that you would like to analyze further can be selected by clicking the corresponding row in the table below. This table shows whatever lines are currently highlighted on the parallel coordinates plot, and is indexed by the same ID number that appears in the parallel coordinates plot. 

Once you have selected a few designs, proceed to the **climate change robustness analysis** tab.
